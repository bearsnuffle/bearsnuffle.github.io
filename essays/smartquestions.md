This is a short little meta-essay. I am not supposed to write as if I am doing it for an assignment, however, to not look like a complete butt, I am going to disclose my mission. 

As a burgeoning software developer it is only natural I will have to utilize the minds of other programmers to help me solve some of my own problems. If you have ever spent time on the internet or read Youtube or Reddit comments you will
know that this can be an experience in and of itself. Despite the wide variety of personalities on the interwebs, we can take our own steps to minimize the rage induced by and towards by being as clear and responsible as we can be.

Today I will venture on StackOverflow and look for some examples of people asking questions the "smart" way and the "not so smart" way, per [Mr.Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)

# A Smart Question

This was a relatively simple question I assume off the answer reponse. The poster was asking sizing a background image in HTML. The asker was concise and specific, put his code directly into the post (not an image) 
and described what he did and his problem and goal specifically. As such, he got a quick and also concise solution to his problem. 

See: [Set div height to image background size after width resizing at 100](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79656333/set-div-height-to-image-background-size-after-width-resizing-at-100)

# A Dumb Question

This guy seems to be trying to create some type of block layout in JavaScript. He put his actual code into the question which is good, but as you read on you get to this part: *"Please don't explain in words how this should work, 
but show an example of code on java script!"*

Being picky towards the people who you are asking for help from does not seem like a good idea. As someone mentioned in the replies, these questions are meant to not only help teach the questioner about something they don't know
but also to help out someone else who might be facing the same or similar problem. By forcing people to answer in code it prevents others from being able to clearly understand the issue, and moreso it makes the answerer feel like
they are just being used to solve the problem for you, not provide any actualy assistance or growth. At that point, you are better off just asking ChatGPT.
